The Cursed Deagle is a weapon purchasable by the Traitor. It will change the role of whoever it hits into a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2535321538]Cursed[/URL]. It only has one shot, and may not be used against Detectives. 
 
While this will effectively instantly eliminate a player from an enemy team, it can backfire on the shooter due to the Cursed's role swapping abilities.
